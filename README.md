# COVID-19 DATA ANALYSIS
Using Python and its data analysis libraries, this project examines COVID-19 cases across the U.S. from 2020-2022

## OBJECTIVES ##
- Identify top 5 counties and states with the highest cumulative COVID-19 cases.
- Determine the first reported cases for each of the top regions
- Visualize findings

## TOOLS/LIBRARIES USED ##
- Python for coding
- `Pandas` — data manipulation
- `NumPy` — numerical operations
- `GeoPandas` — geographic data processing
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` — data visualization
- `Folium` — interactive heat maps
- `fsspec`, `aiohttp` — for working with large datasets and remote file access

## VISUALIZATIONS ##
- Bar charts to display top 5 counties and states with highest cumulative cases
- Line plots to display COVID-19 trends over time
- Interactive Heat maps to display the top 5 counties and states
